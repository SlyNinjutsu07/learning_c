Hello World

There is a specially defined macro called EOF. A macro is one of those things you do with "#define" at the top of a program. e.g.:

#define COUNT 5

Basically any mentions of "COUNT" is replaced with the number '5' when the program runs through the code, and that is what a "macro" is. 
EOF is a macro that returns a char that symbolizes the end of the file in a text file. 
But there is no such representation for this "end-of-line" char, so it's not a part of the 255 combinations for a char. 
Thus, in order to return EOF along with all the possible chars, the following function has to return an 'int': fgetc(FILE *f). 
This is also possible because char's are also ints, or can be expressed through int.
